# Overview

mirrord helps developers improve their **development experience** by seamlessly mirroring Kubernetes traffic and configuration from staging or testing environments directly into their local environment. This allows developers to test their locally written code in a production-like environment without going through tedious CI pipelines or repeatedly having to build and deploy container images.

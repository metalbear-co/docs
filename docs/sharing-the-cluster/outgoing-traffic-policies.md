# Outgoing Traffic Policies

Cluster administrators can restrict which resources and endpoints can be accessed when using mirrord.
Outgoing traffic restrictions are defined using a `MirrordPolicy` or `MirrordClusterPolicy` resource and enforced by the mirrord operator.

_Supported in mirrord Operator version 3.135.1_
{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is available to users on the Team and Enterprise pricing plans.

#### Example Policy
```yaml
apiVersion: policies.mirrord.metalbear.co/v1alpha
kind: MirrordPolicy
metadata:
  name: block-mirroring-from-boats-deployment
  namespace: default
spec:
  block: []
  network:
    outgoing:
      allow:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 10.0.0.0/16
            except:
              - 10.0.5.0/24
          ports:
            - protocol: TCP
              port: 80
            - protocol: TCP
              port: 443
            - protocol: UDP
              port: 53
        - hostname: "^metalbear\\.(co|com)$"
          ports:
            - protocol: TCP
              port: 443
      block:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
          ports:
            - protocol: TCP
              port: 22
```

### Rule fields
Rules under allow or block are arrays of objects. Each object matches when all its fields align with the connection details.
​
#### Available fields:
`ipBlock`: Specifies CIDR ranges via `cidr` field with optional exclusions (`except` field, array of CIDRs).

`hostname`: Regex pattern (e.g., `^metalbear\\.(co|com)$`) for flexible matching.

`ports`: Array of objects with protocol (TCP/UDP) and port.
​

### Evaluation Logic
Policies evaluate runtime outgoing connections as follows:

1. No rules: If no allow or block rules exist, the connection is permitted.

2. Allow rules check: If allow rules exist but none match, the connection is forbidden.

3. Block rules precedence: If block rules exist and any match, the connection is forbidden (even if an allow rule would permit it).

4. Otherwise permitted: All other cases allow the connection.

Note: This differs from a strict "block by default" when no rules are present - empty policies remain permissive until rules are added.

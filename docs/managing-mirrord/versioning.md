description: Versioning and compatibility between mirrord components
---

# Versioning

mirrord is composed of multiple components, including the CLI, Operator, Agent, and License Server. These components may be deployed and upgraded independently, and mirrord is designed to support safe, incremental upgrades in production environments.

This page describes how versioning and compatibility work across mirrord components.

### Component Compatibility

mirrord components communicate over well-defined APIs and do not require lockstep upgrades. In most cases, components can be upgraded independently as long as they remain within the same major version.

### License Server and Operator Compatibility

The mirrord License Server and mirrord Operator are backward compatible with each other within the same major version.

This means that a newer License Server can serve older Operators, and a newer Operator can communicate with older License Servers. Minor and patch upgrades do not require coordinated rollouts between these components.

Breaking changes between the License Server and Operator only occur on major version upgrades.

### Operator and Agent Compatibility

Agents are deployed and managed by the mirrord Operator.

The Operator selects and manages the Agent version automatically. Users should not manually manage Agent image versions when using the Operator.

Operator and Agent compatibility is guaranteed within the same Operator release.

### Upgrade Order

When upgrading mirrord components, the following order is recommended:

* Upgrade the License Server
* Verify that the License Server is healthy and reachable
* Upgrade the mirrord Operator
* Upgrade client tooling (CLI) as needed

Upgrading the License Server first is safe because Operators are backward compatible with newer License Server versions within the same major version.

### Semantic Versioning

mirrord follows semantic versioning for all components.

Patch releases include bug fixes only. Minor releases are backward compatible across components. Major releases may introduce breaking changes.

Cross-component compatibility is guaranteed within the same major version. Any breaking changes will be documented in release notes and upgrade documentation.

# Installing mirrord

mirrord can be installed and used in several ways depending on your development workflow:

- **[CLI](cli.md)** - Install the mirrord command-line tool directly
- **[VS Code](vscode.md)** - Install the mirrord extension for Visual Studio Code and compatible editors (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
- **[JetBrains IDEs](intellij.md)** - Install the mirrord plugin for JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, PyCharm, GoLand, etc.)
- **[WSL](wsl.md)** - Set up mirrord on Windows using the Windows Subsystem for Linux

## Local Requirements

For your local machine, you may use any of:
- MacOS (Intel, Apple Silicon)
- Linux (x86_64)
- Windows (x86_64), WSL (x86_64)
  - IDE plugins support for native mirrord for Windows is currently not supported

kubectl needs to be configured on the local machine.

## mirrord for Teams

If you're planning to use [mirrord for Teams](https://app.metalbear.com), you'll also need to install the mirrord Operator. See the [mirrord for Teams](../overview/teams.md) page for installation instructions.
